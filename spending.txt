Notes from the Boy’s Personal Journal

1.  “I try to keep Swiggy orders limited but during exams it becomes
    impossible to avoid.”
2.  “The PG Wi-Fi sucks sometimes, so I use mobile hotspot which
    increases my recharge cost.”
3.  “Traveling in Bengaluru traffic is the worst, so I prefer metro
    whenever possible.”
4.  “I save some money by sharing OTT subscriptions with friends.”
5.  “Unexpected events like birthdays or outings always disturb the
    budget.”
6.  “Freelancing helps a lot but projects are not consistent.”
7.  “I want to buy a new laptop next year, so I try to save at least
    ₹1,000–₹2,000 every month.”
